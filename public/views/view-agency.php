                    From a single login you can spin up development restaurants, configure menus,
                    connect domains and align the entire design system with each brand. When a
                    restaurant is ready for production, you transfer ownership — just like in
                    Shopify — and keep collaboration access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your clients own the restaurant, billing and legal responsibilities. You keep
                    control of the menu experience and a recurring share of every in-menu payment.

                Agencies connect their own Stripe account once. From there, every restaurant they
                onboard can go live on their own subscription, while the agency keeps a recurring
                0.5% share on in-menu payments.

                <p>
                    When you sign up as an agency, MaxMenu walks you through a Stripe Connect flow
                    where you add your business details and payout information. This is how we send
                    you your 0.5% partner fee on every item payment.

                Agencies can work exactly like they do with Shopify stores: create development
                restaurants under their account, build everything, and then transfer the restaurant
                to the real owner in a single, formal step — without losing access.

                            You design the entire menu, connect the widget to the client’s website
                            and fine-tune the experience without asking for a payment method.
                        </li>

                            <strong>Invite the owner to take over.</strong>
                            When the project is ready, you trigger an ownership transfer. The owner
                            receives a secure link to claim the restaurant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The owner adds their billing details.</strong>
                            They connect their Stripe customer and choose the subscription plan.
                            From that moment, they are the legal and fiscal owner of the restaurant.
                        </li>

                            Your agency keeps access through the agency panel, can continue updating
                            the menu, and receives the 0.5% fee on item payments.
                        </li>

                <p class="transfer-note">
                    The result is a clean separation of responsibilities: the restaurant owns the
                    business and payments; the agency owns the experience and earns on top of it.
